About the project
Sabili Orphans stores and manages detailed records about orphans. It links personal data with health, education, and financial records. It tracks sponsor relationships and sponsorship histories. The web app provides the following:
- Admin dashboard for system control.
- Supervisor views for daily checks.
- Forms for medical, education, and social history.
- File storage and preview using PDF.js.
- Excel export and import for data exchange.
- Arabic UI with RTL support.
- Role-based access control.

The app suits NGOs, charity branches, and social services that track many children and sponsors.

Key features
- Orphan profiles: personal data, ID, family history, status.
- Case files: multiple linked records per orphan.
- Medical records: diagnoses, visits, immunizations.
- Education records: schools, grades, attendance.
- Financial records: aid history, pledges, payments.
- Sponsorship: link sponsors to orphans, manage contracts.
- Documents: upload, tag, and preview PDF and images.
- Excel export: export lists, reports, and details.
- PDF preview: in-browser viewer via PDF.js.
- Arabic interface: full RTL support and translations.
- Multi-user: admin, supervisor, data clerk roles.
- Reports: custom filters and printable PDFs.
- Audit logs: track changes by user and timestamp.

System design
Sabili Orphans splits into clear layers:
- Back-end: Laravel 10. It hosts the REST API, jobs, and scheduled tasks.
- Front-end: Vue 3 with single-page views. It uses Bootstrap 5 and custom RTL CSS.
- Database: MySQL 8. Normalized tables for records and relations.
- File storage: Local storage or cloud (S3). Files include scanned documents and photos.
- Queue: Redis or database queue for heavy tasks like export.
- Worker: php artisan queue:work for background jobs.
- Scheduler: Laravel scheduler for daily jobs like reminders.

Design goals
- Keep the schema simple.
- Make the API predictable.
- Use short, stable endpoints.
- Store large files outside the DB.
- Log user actions for audits.

Data model
Core tables and key fields. Use these as a base for migration files.

- users
  - id, name, email, password, role, active, last_login
- orphans
  - id, first_name, last_name, dob, gender, birth_place, national_id, status, guardian_name, guardian_contact, created_by
- sponsors
  - id, name, contact, address, email, active
- sponsorships
  - id, orphan_id, sponsor_id, start_date, end_date, status, amount, notes
- medical_records
  - id, orphan_id, visit_date, diagnosis, treatment, doctor, attachments
- education_records
  - id, orphan_id, school_name, grade, year, attendance_rate, remarks
- financial_aid
  - id, orphan_id, amount, date, source, purpose, reference
- files
  - id, owner_type, owner_id, filename, path, mime_type, size, uploaded_by
- audit_logs
  - id, user_id, action, table_name, record_id, changes, ip, created_at

Relational notes
- Use foreign keys for orphan_id, sponsor_id.
- Use polymorphic relation for files (owner_type and owner_id).
- Use soft deletes on orphans and sponsors for safety.

API reference
All endpoints return JSON. Use token or session auth. Many endpoints use pagination.

Auth
- POST /api/login
  - body: { email, password }
  - returns: token, user

- POST /api/logout
  - requires: token

Orphan CRUD
- GET /api/orphans
  - query: page, per_page, status, sponsor_id, search
- GET /api/orphans/{id}
- POST /api/orphans
  - body: orphan payload
- PUT /api/orphans/{id}
- DELETE /api/orphans/{id}

Sponsorships
- GET /api/sponsorships
- POST /api/sponsorships

Export tasks
- Exports run as background jobs.

Use curl for API testing.

curl --location --request POST 'https://example.org/api/login' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{"email":"admin@example.org","password":"secret"}'

Front-end structure
The front-end sits in /resources/js or /frontend. It uses Vue 3 with composition API.

Component groups
- Dashboard: widgets, charts, KPI cards
- Orphan: list, profile, timeline
- Sponsor: list, profile, payments
- Files: uploader, browser, PDF viewer
- Reports: parameters, export actions
- Auth: login, forgot password
- Settings: users, roles, lookup tables

Routing
- /login
- /dashboard
- /orphans
- /orphans/{id}
- /sponsors
- /files
- /reports
- /settings

State management
- Use Pinia or Vuex.
- Keep small, focused stores.
- Use actions to call the API.
- Keep the UI reactive and simple.

Styling
- Bootstrap 5 for base layout.
- Custom variables for brand colors.
- RTL stylesheet for Arabic.
- Use utility classes for spacing and layout.

Usage: roles and flows
Users and roles
- Admin
  - Full access.
  - Manage users and roles.
  - Approve sponsorships.
  - Run exports.
- Supervisor
  - View orphan lists.
  - Approve case entries.
  - Review daily checks.
- Data Clerk
  - Create and edit orphan records.
  - Upload files.
  - Record medical and education updates.

Common flows
- New orphan intake
  - Clerk creates a new profile.
  - Clerk uploads ID and guardian documents.
  - Supervisor reviews and approves.
- Assign sponsor
  - Admin opens sponsorship.
  - Link sponsor to orphan.
  - Set start and end dates and pledge amount.
- Upload medical report
  - Clerk uploads PDF.
  - System links file to orphan medical record.
  - Supervisor can preview with PDF.js.
- Export roster
  - Admin sets filters.
  - Request Excel export.
  - System queues export and returns a link.

File management
Files sit in a structured storage path. Files use a polymorphic relation. The UI uses a file browser to preview and download.

File types
- PDFs (medical reports, IDs)
- Images (photos)
- Excel (import templates)
- Docs (agreements)

File size and limits
- Default upload limit: 10 MB per file
- Increase via php.ini upload_max_filesize and post_max_size
- Use chunked uploads for large files

Preview engine
- PDF.js for in-browser preview.
- Images preview via HTML img.
- Office files convert to PDF on the server for preview, if needed.

File lifecycle
- Upload with owner_type and owner_id.
- Tag and add metadata.
- Use retention policies for archival.
- Use signed URLs for S3 downloads.

Reporting and export
Reports use server-side filters. Exports generate XLSX or PDF. Large exports run as background jobs and store results in storage/app/exports.

Common reports
- Active orphan roster
- Orphans by age group
- Sponsor contributions
- Medical visits per month
- Education outcomes by school

Export flow
1. User selects report and filters.
2. User requests export in Excel or PDF.
3. API queues export job.
4. Worker generates file.
5. System posts file to storage and returns a link.
6. User downloads the file.

Export file naming
- sabili_orphans_report_{type}_{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}.xlsx

Excel templates
- Use PhpSpreadsheet.
- Export uses simple sheets and safe cell typing.
- Format date columns.
- Include a header row with human labels.
- Include an export manifest sheet with filters used.

Arabic interface and RTL
The app supports Arabic translation and right-to-left layout.

Implementation
- Use Laravel localization files: resources/lang/ar
- Use direction-aware CSS: [dir="rtl"] rules
- Switch layout classes when locale is Arabic
- Mirror Bootstrap layout with RTL utilities or use bootstrap-rtl

Content
- Provide translated labels for forms, buttons, and messages.
- Keep short labels for UI clarity.
- Use Arabic numerals where needed.
- Use clear Arabic that matches field-level meaning.

Form behavior
- Align labels to the right for RTL.
- Place validation messages under the field.
- Keep input masks for phone and ID fields.

PDF.js
- Embed PDF.js viewer for file preview.
- Use secure signed links for cloud files.
- Provide a full-screen preview and print controls.

Security and backups
Security measures
- Use HTTPS everywhere.
- Use prepared statements and parameter binding.
- Validate all file uploads by mime type and size.
- Sanitize user input.
- Use strong password hashing (bcrypt or Argon2).
- Enforce role checks on server side.
- Rate limit authentication endpoints.

Access control
- Gate or policy per model.
- Restrict file downloads by role and owner.
- Audit log all changes to sensitive records.

Backups
- Backup DB daily.
- Back up files depending on retention policy.
- Use automated scripts to push backups to cloud storage.
- Test restores regularly.

Disaster recovery
- Keep a copy of .env in a secure place.
- Keep migration files to recreate schema.
- Keep a seed for admin account.

Testing and CI
Testing
- Use PHPUnit for backend tests.
- Use Pest for simpler test syntax if preferred.
- Test API endpoints for auth, CRUD, and exports.
- Test file upload logic with test files.
- Test migrations and seeders.

Example test command
php artisan test

CI pipeline
- Run tests on commit.

Recommended CI steps
1. Install PHP dependencies.
2. Install NPM dependencies.
3. Run linting.
4. Run unit tests.
5. Build assets.
6. Deploy on tag or release.
